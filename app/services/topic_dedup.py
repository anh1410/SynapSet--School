"""Merges near-duplicate topic nodes created by ingesting overlapping material
multiple times (e.g. "Public Cloud" extracted once, "Public Clouds" extracted
again from a different chunk/document). Deliberately conservative: it only
merges nodes whose normalized ids differ by a trailing "s" (simple singular/
plural variants), which is what's actually been observed in practice, rather
than a fuzzy similarity threshold that risks merging genuinely distinct topics.
